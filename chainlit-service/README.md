# We-Relate Coaching Instructions 🎭💬

Welcome to We-Relate! This app helps you practice difficult conversations by simulating interactions with someone specific in your life.

## How to Use the App

### Step 1: Profile the Person 💻
First, you'll describe the person you want to practice talking with. Be as detailed as possible about:

- **Your relationship** to them (spouse, boss, friend, family member, etc.)
- **Their personality traits** and communication style
- **How they typically react** in difficult situations
- **Any specific behaviors** or patterns they have
- **Mental health conditions** they may have (if relevant)

The profiler will ask follow-up questions to get enough detail to create a realistic simulation. When you see a summary, type **"confirm"** if it's accurate.

### Step 2: Set the Scenario 💻
Next, describe the specific situation you want to practice:

- **What triggered** the difficult conversation?
- **Where and when** is this happening?
- **What do you hope** to accomplish?
- **What's at stake** in this conversation?

Examples:
- "I came home late and my partner is upset about it"
- "I need to ask my boss for a raise"
- "My teenager broke curfew and I need to address it"

### Step 3: Practice the Conversation 🏋️🤼

Once setup is complete, you can start practicing! The app will automatically detect whether your message is:

- **For the Coach** 🏋️ - Questions like "What should I say?" or "How am I doing?"
- **For the Other Person** 🤼 - Direct responses to what they said

#### When you talk to the Other Person:
1. They'll respond as that person would in real life
2. The Coach will immediately give you feedback
3. You can continue the conversation naturally

#### When you talk to the Coach:
- Ask for guidance: "What's the best approach here?"
- Request feedback: "How did that come across?"
- Get suggestions: "What should I say next?"
- Seek insights: "Why are they reacting this way?"

## Tips for Effective Practice

### 🎯 Be Specific
The more detail you provide about the person and scenario, the more realistic and helpful the practice will be.

### 🎭 Stay in Character
Respond as you naturally would in the real situation. Don't overthink it - your first instincts are valuable data.

### 🏋️ Use the Coach
Don't hesitate to ask for guidance. The coach can help you:
- Understand the other person's perspective
- Find better ways to express yourself
- Navigate emotional moments
- Practice specific de-escalation techniques

### 🔄 Practice Multiple Approaches
Try different responses to see how the conversation changes. You can always restart if you want to try a completely different approach.

### 📝 Focus on Learning
Pay attention to:
- What triggers strong reactions
- Which approaches work better
- How your word choices affect the conversation
- Patterns in your communication style

## Understanding the Icons

- 💻 **Computer** - System messages and configuration steps
- 🏋️ **Lifting Weights** - Coach providing guidance and feedback  
- 🤼 **Wrestling** - The other person you're practicing with

## Getting the Most Out of Your Practice

1. **Be honest** about the relationship dynamics
2. **Practice regularly** - communication skills improve with repetition
3. **Try challenging scenarios** - growth happens outside your comfort zone
4. **Apply insights** to real conversations
5. **Come back** to practice before important conversations

Remember: This is a safe space to make mistakes and learn. The goal is to build your confidence and skills for real-world conversations.
