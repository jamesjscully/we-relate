Welcome to the **We-Relate Two-Agent Demo** - a practice environment for intentional dialogue and de-escalation techniques.

## How It Works 🎯

This demo features an automated conversation using flexible chat strategies:

- **🧑‍🏫 Teacher Strategy**: Asks numerical questions and provides feedback

- **🔄 Flexible LLM Support**: Compatible with OpenAI, Grok, and other providers
- **👤 You**: Can observe the conversation or interact with either strategy

## Getting Started 🚀

3. **Learn from the Process**: Observe how structured dialogue can facilitate learning and understanding

## Features ✨
